Simple generator for tracefiles using the random waypoint mobility model

= Introduction =

rwpy is a simple implementation of the Random Waypoint
mobility model (RWP), which generates mobility traces for
a ﬁxed number _n_ of nodes, given a running time _tr_ . This ap-
plication is essentially a proof-of-concept, as RWP mobility
can easily be implemented in a MF-derived mobility module.
One such module, RandomWaypointMobility, is actually provided with the opposim demonstration
A scripting approach to this simple mobility model is thus
not strictly necessary. Like UrbanMobility, rwpy generates
a XML [TraceFileFormat traceﬁle] of create, destroy and waypoint events.

== Usage ==

Please refer to the general notes on the MobiTrace toolbox page. The script takes the following parameters:

  rwpy {options} filename
    where options are:
       -h|--help      Display help text
       -n|--nodes     Number of generated nodes (default 10)
       -t|--time      Scenario time (default 3600 sec)
       -x|--xmax      Scenario width (default 1000 m)
       -y|--ymax      Scenario height (default 1000 m)
       -v|--velocity  Mean velocity (m/s)
       -s|--vel_sd    Standard deviation of the velocity 
       -p|--pause     Mean pause time (sec)
       -d|--pause_sd  Standard deviation of the pause times

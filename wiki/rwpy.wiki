Simple generator for tracefiles using the random waypoint mobility model

= Introduction =

rwpy is a simple implementation of the Random Waypoint
mobility model (RWP), which generates mobility traces for
a ﬁxed number _n_ of nodes, given a running time _tr_ . This ap-
plication is essentially a proof-of-concept, as RWP mobility
can easily be implemented in a MF-derived mobility module.
One such module, RandomWaypointMobility, is actually provided with the opposim demonstration
A scripting approach to this simple mobility model is thus
not strictly necessary. Like UrbanMobility, rwpy generates
a XML [TraceFileFormat traceﬁle] of create, destroy and waypoint events.

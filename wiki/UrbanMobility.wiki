Simple mobility generator for street scenarios

= Introduction =

The *UrbanMobility* tool is a part of the MobiTrace toolbox for opponet. 
It generates mobility patterns of nodes
(pedestrians, vehicles etc.) in an urban area. It takes as in-
put a map, routing probabilities and a set of generators. The
map speciÔ¨Åes a grid of streets and intersections in the form
of a graph of nodes and vertices, along with the node po-
sitions. Node generators can be attached to positions on
the map where each generator is essentially an arrival pro-
cess of nodes, with inter-arrival time and node speed given
by some probability distributions. The routing probabilities
specify node behavior at intersections, i.e. with which prob-
ability each street at the intersection is next selected by the
node. Intersections can also have exits where
nodes can leave the area (for underground transportation,
area boundary etc.). The UrbanMobility tool generates a
[TraceFileFormat mobility trace] in XML format.
